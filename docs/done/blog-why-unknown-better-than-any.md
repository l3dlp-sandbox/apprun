# Why `unknown` is Better Than `any` in TypeScript

## Introduction

TypeScript offers two top types for variables of any type: `any` and `unknown`. While both allow you to assign any value, `unknown` is a safer and more robust alternative to `any`. This post explores why `unknown` is better, its benefits, and how it maintains backward compatibility.

## The Problem with `any`

The `any` type disables type checking for a variable. Once a value is typed as `any`, you can perform any operation on it without compile-time errors. This flexibility comes at the cost of losing all type safety, making it easy to introduce bugs and making refactoring harder.

```typescript
let value: any = "hello world";
value.foo(); // No error at compile time, but will fail at runtime
```

## The Power of `unknown`

The `unknown` type is similar to `any` in that it can hold any value. However, it is much safer because you must perform type checking before using the value. TypeScript enforces this at compile time.

```typescript
let value: unknown = "hello world";
// value.foo(); // Error: Object is of type 'unknown'.

if (typeof value === "string") {
  console.log(value.toUpperCase()); // Safe
}
```

## Benefits of Using `unknown`

1. **Type Safety**: Forces you to check the type before using the value, preventing many runtime errors.
2. **Better Refactoring**: TypeScript will alert you to places where you need to handle unknown types, making code changes safer.
3. **Documentation**: Signals to other developers that the value could be anything and must be handled with care.
4. **Gradual Adoption**: You can incrementally replace `any` with `unknown` to improve code safety without breaking existing code.

## Backward Compatibility

Switching from `any` to `unknown` is usually backward compatible. The main difference is that TypeScript will now require explicit type checks before using the value. This may cause new compile-time errors, but these are beneficialâ€”they highlight places where your code was previously unsafe.

If you need to maintain compatibility with older code, you can use type assertions or type guards to safely narrow `unknown` to a specific type:

```typescript
let value: unknown = getValue();
let str: string = value as string; // Type assertion
```



## Changing Default Generics: `Component<T=any, E=any>` to `Component<T=unknown, E=unknown>`

AppRun used to have the Component classes with generic parameters defaulting to `any`, such as:

```typescript
class Component<T = any, E = any> {}
```

In V3.380.0, AppRun switched these defaults to `unknown`:

```typescript
class Component<T = unknown, E = unknown> {}
```

### Benefits

- **Stronger Type Safety for Consumers**: Users of your API are now required to explicitly handle the type of state and events, reducing accidental misuse and runtime errors.
- **Better Type Inference**: TypeScript will prompt users to specify or narrow types, leading to more robust and self-documenting code.
- **Encourages Best Practices**: Promotes explicit typing and safer code patterns throughout the ecosystem.

### Compatibility

- **Mostly Backward Compatible**: Existing code that explicitly sets `T` and `E` will continue to work as before.
- **Compile-Time Errors for Unsafe Usage**: Code that relied on the permissiveness of `any` may now produce compile-time errors, but these highlight places where type safety was previously lacking.
- **Easy Migration**: Developers can update their code by providing explicit types or using type assertions where necessary.

**Summary:**

Changing default generics from `any` to `unknown` is a low-risk, high-reward improvement for library maintainers. It nudges users toward safer, more maintainable code without breaking most existing usage, and any new errors are opportunities to improve type safety.

## Conclusion

Using `unknown` instead of `any` is a best practice in modern TypeScript. It provides stronger type safety, better documentation, and helps prevent bugs. While it may require a few more type checks, the benefits far outweigh the costs, especially in large or critical codebases.
